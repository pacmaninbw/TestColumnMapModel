# TestColumnMapModel  
Stand alone test of multiple classes that will be added to a QT Abstract Table Model.  

The classes being tested will allow the user to select the data / metrics they want to track in a personal health application using a MySQL database as an information repository.  

The queries generated are tested by pasting them into MySQL WorkBench and executing the query.

This unit test should build and run on any system that has CMake installed.

It was developed on Ubuntu 22.04 using the GNU C++ compiler (version 12 for C++20 standard).

The IDE used to develope it was QT Creator version 6.
